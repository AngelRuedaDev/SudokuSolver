# SudokuSolver
This little project can help you to solve your Sudoku!

## Explanation
Inside `./src` directoy you can see the two Java files that make this program work. I've made this project to refresh my Java skills, for example, I've used recursivity to solve this project. 

### Sudoku
Inside it there is a **Sudoku class** with a constructor, to set up our sudoku object and some functions that we will use to verify if the number can be set in a cell, set up the number and display the sudoku.

* isInRow
* isInColumn
* isIn3x3
* isNumValid
* solveSudoku
* displaySudoku

### SudokuSolver 
Here it is, the main function of the program where all the logic implemented in `Sudoku.java` is executed!

## To-Do
Make a GUI where the user can put his sudoku and the problem shows him if it solvable or not, and if the user wants it shows the solution to.
